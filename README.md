This is branch for use on a React site. Conceptually it's somewhere between the barebones and master branch, but geared for React and fairly minimal.

There are a few little helpers included like the `_redirects` file to automatically work with Netlify and react-router setup for demo purposes.

To test it out - open the dev site (npm run dev and visit /about, /about/hello, /foo, and /)
